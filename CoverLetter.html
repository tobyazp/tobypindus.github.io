    <h1>Cover Letter</h1>
    <p><b>Dear Hiring Manager,</b>
        As a Communication major, verbal and written communication is central to my academic responsibility. I have
        spent much of my academic career and internships honing these skills with established experience as a
        copywriter on all social media platforms for New Frontier Data and as a columnist for “helloblyss.com”. I am
        proficient and certificated in excel with applied experience for my internship with New Frontier Data. At
        work, I have created multiple pivot tables and applicable charts to find actionable insights for the
        company. During my time at the University of Washington, I have taken courses in computer science, finance,
        accounting, management, marketing, technical writing, public speaking, information systems, and statistics
        among many others. I hope to merge my creativity as a writer and communicator with my analytical skills in
        my career.


    </p>

    <p>In my current position at Origyn Sport, I helped establish the google analytics platform, established
        marketing goals, and looked at past and present data to bring new people to the platform with a goal of soon
        driving sales. I am looking to enter a Market Research, Marketing Analyst, or Marketing Coordinator role.
        With further financial, management, and established communication skills I am able to effectively
        communicate across different teams. I am continuously seeking to expand my knowledge and skill set, making
        me a valuable asset to any team.
        Thank you for your time and consideration.

        Sincerely,
        Toby Pindus</p>
