        Have you ever wanted to do a pull-up but do not know where to begin? Can you do 10 pull-ups and want to progress
        even further? Are you looking to get that summer physique without paying for a gym membership? Then bodyweight
        training (calisthenics) may be for you! I will teach you the fundamentals of calisthenics utilizing parallettes,
        rings, and pure bodyweight to work your muscles in a way they may not have been worked before.

        I am 21 years old and I have roughly 2 years of experience with calisthenics. I am not an officially certified
        trainer although I have trained many people in the past and do extensive research to understand and progress
        myself. I will work with you to ensure proper form when executing these exercises and I will personalize each
        workout depending on your level of experience. My ideal audience is those living in West LA with experience
        ranging from beginner to intermediate. My hourly rate is $25. If this interests you feel free to reach out!
