        <h1>About Toby Pindus</h1>
        <p> Hello, my name is Tobias but most call me Toby for short. Welcome to my web page! I hope you are excited to
            learn about the fascinating life of me, Toby! Hailing from Los Angeles, California, I
            am currently studying Communication with a minor in
            Business & English. Funny enough, this is actually my final college assignment so the word "currently"
            will be outdated in about a week. I intend to enter a career in marketing and analytics. For the
            last couple years this career path has appealed to me since
            it blends my creativity as a writer and thinker with my analytical mindset. In my free time I enjoy
            practicing calisthenics, playing
            soccer, competitive super smash bros, magic the gathering, and of course,
            hanging out with friends. In my webpage I will be sharing a couple links including my cover letter and
            resume!

        </b>
        <p>As you are clearly interesting in learning more about my unique and unrivaled hobbies I will tell you more!
            As a Calisthenist I train using only my bodyweight! That means exercises primarily limited to push ups, pull
            ups, and various leg exercsies.
            However, these exercsies can be upped in difficulty quite easily by either adding more bodyweight on,
            singleing out each individual hand, or
            emphasizing more core. As a competitive smash player I go to weekly tournaments to test my skills against
            other competing players.
            Magic the Gathering has been a pass time of mine for the last 9 years. I used to enter weekly tournaments
            and even some grand prixs in my time in all formats
            including draft, modern, and standard. As you can tell I was born with the competitive spirit. If you want
            to learn even more,
            I have other hobbies that I will list below. Hopefully, at least one of them resonates with you.
